# Interactive MARTA Map

## **Team**: Abiel (Abe) Abraham, Bliena Tukue, Nevaeh Hull, Ruqayyah Muse

Think about the last time you went to the MARTA station website, what did you think about it? Short and sweet? Not enough information? Well, we have the perfect new and improved MARTA map for you to view and use!Â 

By clicking on a point, the map will provide you with an image as well as a brief synopsis of the train station including a photo of the map, the train line that will take you there, as well as a description of the area.

You can also click on the audio in the top left to hear some Lo-Fi music while exploring the map.
